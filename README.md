# Checkers
## Intro 
My first Python project using the Pygame Library, coding the game - Checkers!

## Requirements

<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/" target="_blank">pipenv</a>

## Explanation  

The checkers game is split into five different classes,and each class is managed in different file:
  1. configutaion.py - holds all the components and the configurations
  2. piece.py - all the info regarding each piece is stored using this class + drawing the pieces into the board and crowning       function
  3. board.py - this class is in charge of creating and drawing the board
  4. player.py - As the name impleis this class holds all the functions that are related to making the moves
  5. chekers.py - The main file that makes it possible for us to play the checkers game with GUI
